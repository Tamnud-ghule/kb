You are an AI front-end engineer tasked with building a fully responsive landing page for a B2B data-service startup. The page must be implemented in React (create-react-app or Next.js), styled with Tailwind CSS, and use a strict grayscale color palette (black, white, and shades of gray only). Don’t add any other colors.

Structure your code into clear, reusable components for each of the following sections—wrapping them in a top-level `<LandingPage>` component:

1. **HeroSection**  
   - Full-viewport height.  
   - Headline: “Enterprise-Grade Data, Zero Risk.”  
   - Subheadline: “On-demand, fully compliant datasets—collected, validated, encrypted, and delivered by security-first experts.”  
   - Two buttons: “Get Your Free Preview” (primary style) and “Speak with a Data Specialist” (secondary style).  
   - Background: subtle grayscale gradient or image overlay.

2. **HowItWorks**  
   - Four horizontally or vertically aligned steps.  
   - Step titles and descriptions as provided.  
   - Include simple numbered icons or bullets styled in gray.

3. **IndustriesServed**  
   - Display four industry cards (Healthcare & Pharma, Banking & Insurance, Legal & Compliance, Market Research).  
   - Each card includes an icon or emoji (in gray), a heading, and one line of example use case.  
   - Include the testimonial quote (“With their data powering our analytics, we cut compliance-related incidents by 35%.”) under the heading.

4. **SampleDatasetPreview**  
   - Two-column layout: left: short description/benefits, right: two CTA buttons (“Request Preview” and “Submit Custom Brief”).  
   - Enclose the schema preview “lock” icon in gray.

5. **SecurityCompliance**  
   - List of four bullet-points with icons:  
     • AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, RBAC  
     • GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, ISO 27001  
     • Pseudonymization, k-anonymity, secure enclaves  
     • Real-time logs, SOC 2 reports, compliance dossiers

6. **WhyChooseUs**  
   - Vertical list of five differentiators, each prefixed by a gray checkmark icon.  
   - Use concise benefit-driven copy.

7. **FAQs**  
   - Accordion component with the four Q&A pairs.

8. **ContactCTA**  
   - Centered call-to-action:  
     “Ready to Transform Your Data Strategy?”  
     Buttons: “Schedule a 15-Minute Call” and “Get Free Preview.”

9. **Footer**  
   - Simple footer with text links: About • Security & Compliance • Terms of Service • Privacy Policy • Careers • Blog  
   - Social icons for LinkedIn, Twitter, Email (all in gray).

**Technical requirements:**  
- Use functional React components and hooks only.  
- All styling via Tailwind CSS utility classes.  
- Mobile-first, fully responsive design.  
- Semantic HTML (use `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).  
- Export a single `LandingPage` component that renders each section in order.  
- No external images or colors outside grayscale—use placeholder SVGs or emojis for icons.  
- Include comments at the top of each component summarizing its purpose.

Generate the initial code structure and component stubs with placeholder text/content. Once the scaffold is ready, fill in all the copy exactly as defined in our section outlines above.
